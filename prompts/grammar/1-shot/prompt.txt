You are the best programmar in the world.
You will be asked to determine the grammar and the constraint of the given specification by following the general rules and the structure of the given five examples.
I will first give you the general rules and the examples of how the grammars and the constraints are constructed from the specifications along with the reasons.
After analyzing the general rules, examples and learning how to generate the grammar and the constraint from the specification,
I will ask you to generate the grammar and the constraint for the last specification by following the rules and the examples.
General rules for making a grammar:
1) <S> -> Start non-terminal: Represents the starting point of the grammar.
2) [variable] -> counter variable: Enclose variable names in brackets to indicate they are counters variables and includes corresponding counter non-terminals like <T_variable>.
3) <s>, <n> -> space and enter token: Use <s> and <n> to denote space and newline characters respectively.
4) <T_i> -> counter non-terminal: Represents a non-terminal that controls a sequence repeated according to a counter variable that is enclosed in [].
5) Use regex expressions (e.g., [a-zA-Z]{1,100}) to define ranges for characters. These can include symbols, numbers, or letters, specifying minimum and maximum lengths in {}. Use regex excpressions only when needed only.
6) If the regex exressions is a sequence of only one character, use {1} to specify its length.
7) If there are multiple counter variables, use <L_i> for the second one and <Z_i> for the third one. 
8) When two variables on the same line act as counter variables, represent each with a respective non-terminal, such as <T_variable> and <L_variable> followed by <T_i> amd <L_i>.
9) For additional counters beyond three, any single alphabet can be used.
10) Each counter non-terminal should decrement until it reaches 1, e.g., <T_1>.
11) Enclose counter non-terminals in [] only if they are associated with a counter variable.
12) Include all variables mentioned in constraints within the grammar structure.
13) Strictly utilize identifiers such as <L_i>, <T_i>, etc., consistently across the grammar and nothing else.
14) Ensure all counter non-terminals are correctly and consistently represented without omissions.
15) If there are two counter non terminal in the same line then use <T_variable> and <L_varibale> where the variable could be anything enclosed in '[]'. String do not use <T_variable> and <L_variable>.
16) If the variable is replaced by the regex replace it at the moment only when the regex expressions are required, do not create a counter non-terminal.
Strictly follow the rules and enclose only those variables in [] that will serve as a counter non-terminal, other variables should not be enclosed in [].
<Specification> "Constraints\n\n* 1 \\leq N \\leq 100\n* 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 1000\n\nInput\n\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n\n\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_N" </Specification>
<Reason> "The grammar begins with the start symbol <S>. Here, 'N' is used as a counter variable for the array elements, thus it is denoted as [N] in the grammar to reflect its role as a counter. If 'N' were not a counter, it would be represented simply as 'N'. All variables that serve as counters are similarly denoted with brackets. Consequently, the grammar is initiated with '<S>->[N] <n> <T_N>'. The non-terminal <T_i> is a counter-driven rule for [N], where 'A_i' represents each array element separated by a space symbol <s>. The grammar constructs are laid out as '<S>->[N] <n> <T_N>', '<T_i>-><T_i-1> <s> A_i', and '<T_1>->A_1' to systematically parse the sequence of array elements following the count [N]." </Reason>
<Grammar> "<S>->[N] <n> <T_N>", "<T_i>-><T_i-1> <s> A_i", "<T_1>->A_1" </Grammar>
<Constraint> "1<=n<=100", "1<=A_i<=1000" </Constraint>
<Specification> "{Specification}" </Specification>
Generate the <Grammar> and <Constraint> for the given last <Specification> by strictly following the general rules and the examples provided without changing its basic structure from the examples in a json format.
Json format should be
{"grammar": {"productions": [grammar for the Specification], "constraints": [constraint for the Specification]}}.
